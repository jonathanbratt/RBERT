# RBERT

RBERT is an R implementation of the Python package [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert)
developed at Google for Natural Language Processing.


### Basic usage

RBERT is a work in progress. While fine-tuning a BERT model using RBERT may be possible, it is not currently recommended.

RBERT is best suited for exploring pre-trained BERT models, and obtaining contextual representations of input text for use as features in downstream tasks.

See the "Introduction to RBERT" vignette included with the package for more specific examples.
