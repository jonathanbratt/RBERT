make_examples_simple(seq_list)

A list of \code{InputExample_EF} objects.

\description{
A simple wrapper function to turn a list of text (as a character
vector or list) into a list of examples suitable for use with RBERT. If the
input is a flat list or vector of characters, the examples will be
single-segment, with NULL for the second segment. If the input contains
length-2 sublists or vectors, those examples will be two-segment sequences,
e.g. for doing sentence-pair classification.
