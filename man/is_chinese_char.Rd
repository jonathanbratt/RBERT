\description{
(R implementation of BasicTokenizer._is_chinese_char from
BERT: tokenization.py. From that file:
 This defines a "chinese character" as anything in the CJK Unicode block:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_Unified_Ideographs_(Unicode_block)
}
\details{
Note that the CJK Unicode block is NOT all Japanese and Korean characters,
despite its name. The modern Korean Hangul alphabet is a different block,
as is Japanese Hiragana and Katakana. Those alphabets are used to write
space-separated words, so they are not treated specially and are handled
like the alphabets of the other languages.)
