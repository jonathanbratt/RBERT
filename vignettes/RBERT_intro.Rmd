RBERT is an implementation of Google Research's 
[BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) in `R`. 

BERT is a powerful general-purpose language model
(paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf), 
helpful blog post [here](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/)).
BERT is written in Python, using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
An `R` package for TensorFlow already [exists](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/),
so the goal of this project is to fully implement BERT in `R` down to the level
of the TensorFlow API.

Generally speaking, there are three levels at which BERT could be used:

1. Using the output of a pre-trained BERT model as features for downstream model
2. Fine-tuning on top of a pre-trained BERT model
3. Training a BERT model from scratch

Currently, RBERT is functional at the first level, and possibly functional
at the second level (speed becomes a significant consideration at this level).

# Getting started with RBERT

RBERT requires the tensorflow package to be installed and working. If that
requirement is met, using RBERT at the first level is fairly 
straightforward. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(RBERT)

# Download pre-trained BERT model. This will go to an appropriate cache
# directory by default.
BERT_PRETRAINED_DIR <- RBERT::download_BERT_checkpoint(
  model = "bert_base_uncased"
)

vocab_file <- file.path(BERT_PRETRAINED_DIR, 'vocab.txt')
init_checkpoint <- file.path(BERT_PRETRAINED_DIR, 'bert_model.ckpt')
bert_config_file <- file.path(BERT_PRETRAINED_DIR, 'bert_config.json')

text_to_process <- c("Impulse is equal to the change in momentum.",
                     "Changing momentum requires an impulse.",
                     "An impulse is like a push.",
                     "Impulse is force times time.")

# Or make two-segment examples:
text_to_process2 <- list(c("Impulse is equal to the change in momentum.",
                           "Changing momentum requires an impulse."),
                         c("An impulse is like a push.",
                           "Impulse is force times time."))

BERT_feats <- extract_features(
  examples = make_examples_simple(text_to_process2),
  vocab_file = vocab_file,
  bert_config_file = bert_config_file,
  init_checkpoint = init_checkpoint,
  layer_indexes = 1:12,
  batch_size = 2L
)

# Extract the final layer output vector for the "[CLS]" token of the first
# sentence. 
output_vector1 <- BERT_feats$layer_outputs$example_1$features$token_1$layers$layer_output_12$values

# Extract output vectors for all sentences...
# These vectors can be used as input features for downstream models.
# Convenience functions for doing this extraction will be added to the
# package in the near future.
output_vectors <- purrr::map(BERT_feats$layer_outputs, function(sentence) {
  sentence$features$token_1$layers$layer_output_12$values
})

# Clean up.
unlink(temp_dir, recursive = TRUE)
```

# Future work
